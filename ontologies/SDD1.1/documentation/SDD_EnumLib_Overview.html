It documents only the root level annotations and components (elements, global attributes, simple and complex types, and groups). The definition of the components listed here is documented separately (hyperlinking could not yet be implemented).</p><p>Because the UBIF schema is designed as a type library, complex types represent class definitions and most schema files contain only a single root-level element.</p><p>Please see the <a href="rddl.html">schema documentation resource directory</a> for schema overviews of other files and detailed component documentation.</p><hr/><h2>Schema file content</h2><p>The following content is generated automatically from the documentation inside the schema file:</p><p>This file will be included into the UBIF/SDD integration schema 'SDD.xsd' (SDD uses the same namespace as UBIF).</p><p>Copyright Â© 2006 TDWG (Taxonomic Databases Working Group, www.tdwg.org). See the file SDD_(c).xsd for authorship and licensing information.</p><hr/><p><strong>Enumerations to support interoperability:</strong></p><p>Internal formatting note: Annotations of individual enumerated values should be written as "short label" + " -- " + "detailed information" or "[abbreviation]" + " -- " + "short label" + " -- " + "detailed information". An xslt script transforms such schema annotations into a data document that can directly be used in user interfaces.</p><p>Please read: An important feature of this schema file is that these enumerations may be turned into data, many of them including extra specification data. Please see UBIF-EnumerationTools for further information. Using the data files in application development rather than hardcoding enumerations in code enables simple adaption to future versions of UBIF.</p><ul class="compact" compact="compact"><li><strong><a name="NatLangPhraseRoleEnum" id="NatLangPhraseRoleEnum">NatLangPhraseRoleEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Enumerated value expressing the kind of phrase or "wording fragment" used to create natural language reports (especially object descriptions). These are currently highly constrained, but either additional values or free extensibility (by union of this type with xs:anyURI) are expected for future releases of UBIF.</li><li><strong><a name="CharacterTreeRoleEnum" id="CharacterTreeRoleEnum">CharacterTreeRoleEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Defines the intended roles that a designer may assign to a character tree (list of enumerated values to support application interoperability). Note: no values for designing the terminology are given; in the use cases all character trees are available.</li><li><strong><a name="RatingContextEnum" id="RatingContextEnum">RatingContextEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Defines the topic of a concept/character rating.</li><li><strong><a name="DataOriginEnum" id="DataOriginEnum">DataOriginEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Defines the origin of data that may have been entered, calculated, aggregated or inherited</li><li><strong><a name="ModifierClassEnum" id="ModifierClassEnum">ModifierClassEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Defines a subset of possible modifier classes. Used only on those modifiers that need to be typed to achieve application interoperability (especially when modifier specifications add a value-based interpretation for a modifier, like frequency or certainty values). More values may be added to this enumeration in the future.</li><li><strong><a name="UnivarStatMeasureClassEnum" id="UnivarStatMeasureClassEnum">UnivarStatMeasureClassEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): When mapping numerical ranges to categorical states (as in a histogram), several methods which statistical measures are used for the mapping are possible. Using the central value compares a point with the mapping range, whereas using ranges or extremes results in a comparison of two kind of ranges for overlap. Only the central value method can guarantee an unambiguous partitioning into categories. However, the ranges or extremes methods may be desirable because of their improved error tolerance.</li><li><strong><a name="StateCollectionModelEnum" id="StateCollectionModelEnum">StateCollectionModelEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Used in descriptive data (not in terminology): Collections of states in instance documents may be ordered (sequence) or unordered (set), and may be connected with 'and', 'or', 'with', or 'between'. Since set/sequence and operators are dependent on each other, the two aspects are combined into a 'model' enumeration</li><li><strong><a name="MolecularSequenceTypeEnum" id="MolecularSequenceTypeEnum">MolecularSequenceTypeEnum</a></strong> (<em>Simple type</em>, based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xs:QName</a> by restriction): Currently limited to 'Nucleotide' and 'Protein', but future SDD versions may expand this after appropriate discussion. A distinction between nucleotide type-subtypes RNA/DNA is currently not considered necessary; the symbols U (RNA) and T (DNA) should be considered equal for the purpose of analysis.</li></ul><hr/><p>(Generated on 23.
