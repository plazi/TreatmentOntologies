It documents only the root level annotations and components (elements, global attributes, simple and complex types, and groups). The definition of the components listed here is documented separately (hyperlinking could not yet be implemented).</p><p>Because the UBIF schema is designed as a type library, complex types represent class definitions and most schema files contain only a single root-level element.</p><p>Please see the <a href="rddl.html">schema documentation resource directory</a> for schema overviews of other files and detailed component documentation.</p><hr/><h2>Schema file content</h2><p>The following content is generated automatically from the documentation inside the schema file:</p><p>This is the schema file to be referenced in instance documents for validation. It is the top level schema file that integrates the schema components.</p><p>This version integrates UBIF and SDD. To add further object types, this file has to be changed.</p><p>Copyright Â© 2006 TDWG (Taxonomic Databases Working Group, www.tdwg.org).

Multiple Dataset objects are completely independent. Potential relationship may be detected by the consumer, but are not expressed in the UBIF format. The sequence of Dataset objects has no semantics and does not have to be preserved.

The version of the UBIF standard used is defined in the namespace declaration and needs no separate data element.</li></ul><ul class="compact" compact="compact"><li><strong><a name="Dataset" id="Dataset">Dataset</a></strong> (<em>Complex type</em>, based on <em>OwnedAbstractObject</em> by extension): Dataset itself is derived from Abstract object, as are the base types for which it contains collections.

The first elements (Repres., Links, RevisionData, Owner, IPRStatem.) are content metadata for the entire data set / data collection. If, e.g. in response to queries, data subsets are extractet from a larger base data set, these metadata are not required to be specific to each document, but may may describe the base set itself. Link uri should then refer to the base set using rel=BasedUpon, and the dataset-uri may contain a query URI (or be omitted).

If a history of the data collection
(revised or expanded in various
projects or at different institutions, aggregated from multiple sources)
is available, this may be reflected in the IPR statements and possibly in
the list of Owners.

Note: if a data set is an extract from a larger base set, it is recommended to use 'Link rel = BasedOn' to point to the complete data set. Note that this may enable indexing robots to index the entire base data set.</li></ul><hr/><p>(Generated on 23. May 2006 by DiversitySchemaTools Version 0.5. Copyright (c) G.
