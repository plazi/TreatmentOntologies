    <h1>Enumerated value concepts for application building</h1>
    <p>This document is generated by an xslt script from the enumerations present in the following schema: "Unified Biosciences Information Framework (UBIF) 1.1". Enumerations are converted to SDD descriptive concepts (enumerated values are represented by concept states). The html report generated for these values / concept states is intended for documentation and to improve discussion and correction of errors (please comment on http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/EnumeratedValues). The xml representation follows the general conventions of UBIF documents and may be easier to import or integrate into user interfaces than the schema itself. This is especially true for SDD documents, where a large part of the terminology is provided in the form of data documents by the experts of a given knowledge domain. This document can be used side-by-side as schema-defined terminology with user-defined terminology.</p>

    <p>When mapping numerical ranges to categorical states (as in a histogram), several methods which statistical measures are used for the mapping are possible. Using the central value compares a point with the mapping range, whereas using ranges or extremes results in a comparison of two kind of ranges for overlap. Only the central value method can guarantee an unambiguous partitioning into categories. However, the ranges or extremes methods may be desirable because of their improved error tolerance.</p>

A distinction between nucleotide type-subtypes RNA/DNA is currently not considered necessary; the symbols U (RNA) and T (DNA) should be considered equal for the purpose of analysis.</p>
